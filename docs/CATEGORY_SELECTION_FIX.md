# Category Selection Fix for Trivia.Box

## Issue Description

The application wasn't properly respecting the user's category selection when creating a game session. When a player selected a specific category (e.g., History), the questions they received included a significant number from other categories.

## Root Causes

1. **Overly Aggressive Fallback Mechanism**:
   - The `QuestionService.getQuestionsByCategory` method was designed to always return the requested number of questions, even if it had to pull from unrelated categories.
   - This resulted in mixed-category question sets, regardless of the user's selection.

2. **No Prioritization for Selected Category**:
   - When fetching questions, the service didn't prioritize questions from the requested category.
   - After retrieving questions from multiple categories, there was no mechanism to ensure that questions from the selected category were given preference.

3. **Query Issues**:
   - The application was retrieving far more questions than needed from non-requested categories.
   - For example, when looking for 10 history questions, it was pulling 1086 additional questions from other categories.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Category Prioritization in QuestionService

Modified `getQuestionsByCategory` to:
- Always prioritize questions from the requested category first
- Only pull from other categories as a last resort, and in minimal quantities
- Add category breakdown logging to track the source of questions

### 2. Improved Fallback Logic

- Only fetch from other categories if we have less than half the required questions from the specified category
- Apply fallback in stages, first trying all difficulty levels within the same category before going to other categories
- Display clear warnings when the system has to pull from other categories

### 3. Enhanced Logging

Added more detailed logging to help diagnose category selection issues:
- Breakdown of questions by category in the final selection
- Warning messages when using questions from other categories
- Clear indication when not enough questions are found in the requested category

## How to Verify the Fix

1. Create a new game with a specific category selection (e.g., History)
2. Check the server logs during game creation to verify:
   - Questions are primarily coming from the selected category
   - The final selection breakdown shows a strong preference for the selected category
3. Play the game and verify the questions match the selected category

## Further Improvements

Consider these additional enhancements:

1. **Question Database Growth**:
   - Add more questions to categories with low question counts to reduce reliance on fallbacks
   - Implement a system to auto-generate questions for underrepresented categories

2. **Minimum Category Threshold**:
   - Disable category selection in the UI if a category has fewer than X questions
   - Show a "Coming Soon" or "Not Enough Questions" indicator for categories with limited content

3. **User Communication**:
   - Notify users when a perfect category match isn't possible
   - Consider allowing users to opt for fewer questions rather than mixing categories
