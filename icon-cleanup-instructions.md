# Icon Cleanup Instructions

We've identified that the `icons` folder in your public directory is redundant and may be causing confusion with the favicon files directly in the public directory. 

## Recommended Actions:

1. **Delete the redundant icons folder**:
   - First ensure that all needed files are properly saved to the public directory root
   - Then delete the `public/icons` folder since all references now point to files in the public root

2. **Verify all icon file names match exactly**:
   - Your actual files are named with patterns like `favicon-16x16.png` and `android-chrome-192x192.png`
   - We've updated all configurations to match these exact filenames

3. **Consolidate to a single source of truth**:
   - Now all references in `layout.tsx`, `manifest.json`, and `site.webmanifest` point to the same files
   - Removed any unnecessary duplication of icon files

## Post-Deployment Verification:

After deploying these changes:
1. Verify the correct favicon appears in browser tabs
2. Check that the favicon doesn't change to the "B" icon on refresh or navigation
3. Validate your favicon implementation using tools like:
   - https://realfavicongenerator.net/favicon_checker
   - Chrome DevTools > Application > Manifest

This cleanup ensures your application only has a single source of truth for favicons, which will prevent browser confusion about which icon to display.

Note: We've also ensured that your application properly uses `/site.webmanifest` instead of `/manifest.json` to match the actual file present in your public directory.
