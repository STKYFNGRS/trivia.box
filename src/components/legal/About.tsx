            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-amber-400">How It Works</h3>
            <p>

              and sports. Players can customize their game experience by selecting the number of questions, difficulty level,

            </p>
            <p>
              Our global leaderboard lets you compete with players worldwide, while our reward system lets you earn tokens

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-amber-400">Players Share in Our Success</h3>
            <p>
              Trivia.Box operates on a revolutionary principle: <span className="text-amber-300 font-medium">the players who make our game great deserve to share in its success</span>. 
              Unlike traditional platforms that keep all advertising revenue, we&apos;ve created a groundbreaking economic model that directly rewards our community.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you see ads on Trivia.Box, that revenue doesn&apos;t just go to our bottom line—it&apos;s systematically used to provide{' '}
              <span className="text-amber-300 font-medium">real equity value to our token ecosystem</span>. This means every question you answer 
              and every game you play not only tests your knowledge but also contributes to a growing token pool that flows back to our players.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through this player-first approach, your trivia skills translate into tangible rewards. The better you perform, the more you earn—creating 
              a virtuous cycle where your entertainment directly benefits you. It&apos;s not just about playing a game; it&apos;s about being a stakeholder 
              in a community where <span className="text-amber-300 font-medium">your participation has real value</span>.
