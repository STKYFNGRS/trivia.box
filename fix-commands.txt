To fix the achievement service, run:

node fix-achievement-service.js

This will repair just the corrupted sections without attempting a full rewrite of the file.

If that doesn't work, here are the key fixes needed for each achievement:

1. The Perfect Game achievement needs to check for games with 10/10 correct answers
2. The Perfect Streak achievement should verify a whole game with all answers correct (10/10)
3. For Category Master, it should count total correct answers across all categories
4. For General Knowledge/Random Master, it needs to check for those specific categories
5. For Difficulty Master, it only needs to check for distinct difficulty levels with correct answers

You can manually fix these using the file at:
C:\Users\Alex Moore\Trivia.Box\src\services\achievements\achievement-fixes.ts

This file contains optimized implementations for all the achievement checks.
